# Exposed Endpapers
A *pen-pal-inspired* application evolved from journaling.
Seal your memoirs in ink and envelope to send to a stranger whose day mirrors your own.
Share reactions and emotions, so you never feel alone—even in the dullest of days.

The more you share, the more exposed your journal becomes, unlocking its artistic potential.

We are often our own harshest critics and sometimes our own jury.
Let us share our judgments before we become executioners.
Perhaps we will realize our glasses were tinted black all along.
