          <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In recent years people have, by age 25, one in five been diagnosed with a mental illness, with most symptoms beginning before 18.</p>
<p>Globally, one in seven adolescents faces a mental health condition, and suicide remains among the leading causes of death for those aged 15–29.</p>

<h4>Urgent Demand and Changing Access</h4>
<p>Digital platforms bridge gaps in care as rates of physician visits and medication use for children and youth have risen, while hospitalizations and emergency department visits have declined—reflecting a shift to community-based and easily accessible supports. Still, many youth, especially those from vulnerable or underserved populations, do not receive the full care they need, highlighting an urgent demand for innovative, effective, and engaging solutions.
</p>
<h4>Social and Emotional Impact</h4>
<p>Mental illness not only impacts physical health but also increases the risk of poor educational, economic, and social outcomes in adulthood. Addressing these conditions early—through technology that meets youth where they are—can reduce stigma, encourage help-seeking, and offer vital peer and professional support in ways traditional systems often cannot.

By creating relevant software tools, society can offer youth immediate support, skill-building, and crisis intervention, ultimately improving wellbeing, resilience, and life prospects for a generation facing unprecedented mental health challenges.</p>
</p><h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>While the benefits to ... are clear, it is harder to see the tangible benefits that are offered to the users. In fact many people are beginning to... Attempts are already being made by companies to develop marketplaces for people to sell their data but most are either limited in scope (focused on selling data related to specific industrial sectors like healthcare and anonymized home sensor data) or don’t adequately address the fact that selling personal data can be intimidating. The lack of existing solutions that allow people to comfortably exchange their personal data with tech companies can leave the people with a feeling of a lack of control over their online presence and interactions.
