        <h1 class="cover-heading">User Goals</h1>
        <p class="lead"><i>Defining what our platform would help users achieve</i> </p>
        <h2>Features Boosting Mental Health</h2>
        <p class=""><b><a href="prototypes.html">Limited Connections with Deep Engagement:</a></b>&nbsp;By limiting each user to a small number of active pen-pal matches, the platform reduces social overwhelm and encourages more meaningful, focused exchanges. This helps build&nbsp;<em>emotional resilience</em>&nbsp;by fostering genuine, trusted connections, unlike large networks where interactions can feel shallow or stressful.</p>
        <p class=""><b><a href="prototypes.html">Robust User-Controlled Matching:</a></b>&nbsp;Users fully control their matching, choosing partners based on shared or different story themes. This empowerment builds&nbsp;<em>trust</em>&nbsp;by giving users agency over who they connect with&mdash;particularly important for young people skeptical of forced or adult-driven interventions.</p>
        <p class=""><b><a href="prototypes.html">Journal-Sharing as Story Swap:</a></b>&nbsp;The core of sharing two similar or distinct journal-like stories allows emotional expression in a creative, less clinical way. Users can react only with emotion-representing emojis, lowering pressure and enhancing&nbsp;<em>safe emotional expression</em> and mitigating fear of mockery or stigmatisation.</p>
        <p class=""><b><a href="prototypes.html">Self-Reflection and Mail Mode:</a></b>&nbsp;After swapping stories, users can choose to write a self-reflection or rewrite the story as an improved hypothetical scene, which their matched pen-pal may then respond to once, creating a respectful, controlled dialogue (the "Mail Mode"). This encourages&nbsp;<em>developing coping skills</em>&nbsp;by practicing reflection and narrative re-framing, in a paced, non-intrusive manner.</p>
        <p class=""><b><a href="prototypes.html">Gamification Habit Building:</a></b>&nbsp;Rewarding daily journaling streaks and interaction through perks and unlockable styling options fosters motivation and daily practice, strengthening&nbsp;<em>healthy habits</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>emotional resilience</em>. Gamification increases engagement, which research shows is key to meaningful mental health improvements.</p>
        <h2>Building Trust and User Agency</h2>
        <p class="">Exposed Endpapers is designed to earn trust through transparency and user control. Since users initiate and approve all matches and interactions, they never feel forced into connections. This respect for autonomy helps overcome wariness toward adult-driven or overly monitored platforms.</p>
        <p class="">Privacy is enhanced by simple emoji-based reactions limiting exposure, plus the controlled Mail Mode exchange which caps back-and-forth messaging, reducing risks of overwhelming interaction or privacy invasion.</p>
        <p class="">Users can toggle Mail Mode on or off at any time, deciding how much or little interaction to engage in, reinforcing a sense of&nbsp;<em>agency</em>&nbsp;over their mental health journey.</p>
        <p class="">By letting users guide their pace and depth of sharing, Exposed Endpapers gently promotes&nbsp;<em>healthy behaviors</em>&mdash;like self-reflection and seeking support&mdash;without pressure or judgment.</p>
        <p class="lead">Overall, these features combine to create an emotionally safe, engaging space where youth build connection, confidence, and coping skills on their own terms.</p>
